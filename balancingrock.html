            A natural wonder, Balancing Rocks are a set of seemingly delicately balanced eroded volcanic rock formations. Although they look precariously positioned, they have withstood earthquakes of magnitude up to 6.5 on the Richter scale. No wonder that the locals believe these rocks to be as invincible as they are incredible. One rock is balanced on a huge base rock and only touches it slightly. The point of contact between the two rocks is only 6 sq inches. It is believed that it is impossible to disturb the balance of this rock. Many tourists and geologists come to observe and understand the mystery of this place. The area is surrounded by picturesque hillocks and makes for a great natural retreat for visitors. The rocks lie very close to the Madan Mahal Fort in Deotal.
